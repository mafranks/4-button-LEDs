Then, load this code onto the Arduino with Arduino IDE or something similar. Once loaded, you should be able to press the buttons to light up the LEDs.

If you press and hold the buttons in the right order (1,2,3,4), the 5th LED should light up.

The breadboard diagram can be opened with the [Virtual Breadboard](https://www.virtualbreadboard.com/) program.
